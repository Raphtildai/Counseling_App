# Careapp

Careapp is a student counseling system that is a cross-platform mobile app that aims to digitize the entire counseling process.

# Problem Statement

Finding a Counselor can be time-consuming and expensive. One can get emotional support anytime, anywhere with the mental care app. The mental care app aims to bridge the gap between the Counselors and students providing effective interaction with counselors, ensuring security, confidentiality, cost-effectiveness, and anonymity.

# Objectives that this system covers are 
1.	To enable a counselee to book a counseling session online.
2.	To enable a counselee to receive counseling session reminder prior to session date.
3.	To enable a counselee, reschedule an earlier booked counseling session.
4.	To enable a counselor track counseling session for a specific counselee.
5.	To enable the system to generate a monthly report on the gender with the highest request of counseling sessions.


## Getting Started

1.1	Getting Started	
The Student Counseling System application is a widely accessible software that can be downloaded and installed on iOS or Android devices using an APK file. For the majority of its features to be completed, this application needs an internet connection.
1.2	Registration and Logging in
Since registration is necessary to use the software, unregistered users are unable to execute any actions. One must register and enter user information that is valid according to the security measures used on the system before they can proceed to log in with the specified email address and password. If a user forgets their password, they can reset it by providing the email address that was registered for that specific account.
 	 	
1.3	Booking of Counseling Session
Before scheduling a counseling session, one must first check the counselor's calendar to see what days and times they are available. Depending on his or her availability, the counselor will confirm the scheduled appointment.
In order to schedule a counseling session, a valid counseling date and the intended counseling time must be entered or selected.

1.4	Rescheduling of Counseling Session
If done in advance and before the counseling session's approved date, the counselee will have the opportunity to postpone the earlier scheduled appointment.
Rescheduling a counseling session must follow to the same strict guidelines as scheduling one as described in (1.3) above.

1.5	Approving of Counseling Session
After the counselee has planned or rescheduled the counseling session, the counselor will approve it and send information of the approval status as well as any further instructions he or she deems appropriate.
Since only the counselor and the counselee are meant to have access to this information, it must be held in strict confidence.
It is strongly advised against sharing this information because doing so could compromise its security and confidentiality.

1.6	Report Generation
The progress of the counselee's counseling history can be tracked by the counselor, who can then produce reports that can be printed for documentation. Only the Counselee's basic information and the history of the Counselee's counseling booking will be included in this report.
Due to the confidentiality of the information shared between the counselor and the counselee, the contents of the counseling session will NOT be published in this report.
